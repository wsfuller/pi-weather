# Pi Weather

This is a very basic application meant to be used on a large format display. I currently have a Google Calendar used for family coordination. This is an additional view to show time and weather for the day. This is all running on a Raspberry Pi 5 4GB with Ubuntu using Firefox.

This app leverages [Open Weather's API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get current weather and location coordinates when needing to update your location.
